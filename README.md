This project leverages a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify plant diseases using the PlantVillage dataset, which includes 38 different disease classes. The model is designed for real-time disease detection by analyzing images of plant leaves, providing an accessible tool for farmers and agricultural professionals. The system achieves high accuracy and is implemented with a simple web interface where users can upload images to receive instant disease predictions, helping in timely and effective crop management.

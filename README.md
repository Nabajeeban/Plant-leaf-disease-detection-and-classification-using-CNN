Plant Disease Classification using Deep Learning
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify plant diseases from images, helping farmers and agricultural professionals with real-time disease detection.

Features
Real-time Disease Detection: Upload a leaf image to get an instant diagnosis.
High Accuracy: Trained on the PlantVillage dataset with 38 disease classes.
Dataset
Source: PlantVillage Dataset
Classes: 38, including healthy plants.
Preprocessing: Resized and normalized images.
Model
Architecture: CNN with convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers.
Accuracy: Achieved X% on validation and Y% on test data.
Installation
Clone the repo: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/plant-disease-classification.git
Navigate to the directory: cd plant-disease-classification
Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Run the app: python app.py
Access it at http://localhost:5000 and upload a leaf image for prediction.
